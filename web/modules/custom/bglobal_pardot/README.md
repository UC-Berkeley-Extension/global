# Berkeley Global Pardot Forms

This module handles basic forms for Pardot integration. It allows for simple contact forms to be passed through a theme function.

Since we do not use the Drupal form system for data handling, the form templates themselves contain most of the markup that we need for each form.

This module is under development and is built to allow configuration as defined by the variables in `bglobal_pardot_theme()`.

We are using Form Handlers in Pardot. See [considerations for form handlers in the Pardot documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pardot_considerations_for_using_form_handlers.htm&type=0).
