# TODO
#  The image is now sourced from the Extension site. What's the best way to add it?
#      It is the same every time this component is used
#      Only needed on this page
#      If it lived in an /images/ folder in this module, how would we call it here?
#      Found a href="https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/184329/using-images-in-custom-module-not-through-css">this StakOverflow/a> but I don't really understand it
