# Berkeley Global Angular Integration

This module works with the [PDB module](https://www.drupal.org/project/pdb) to create Angular applications as Drupal blocks.

## Creating a block

See the example in `/components/voices_list`.

1. Create a folder with the block name (e.g. courses_list).
1. Create an info file, prefixing the block name with `Angular:`
    1. The machine name in the info file should match the folder name, using dashes (-) instead of underscores (_).
1. Following the file naming conventions used by the `voices_list` example.
